description: "After surpassing 100k plays on Soundcloud, it became clear\r that Ren Riz's disco jam Marmalade deserved an official\r release. \nAccompanying the laid-back, sun-kissed original mix\r is the “Late Night” version – a chopped up disco house\r reinterpretation with a higher tempo and dance floor appeal.\r \nJupiter Direct locks the house groove in with its dubby filtering,\r rolling bass-line and funky guitar loop. Saving dessert for last -\r Pudding is a summery nu-disco tune with a choppy disco\r bass-line and Rhodes chords for days. \nThis release is all about\r summer sunsets & aperitifs"
